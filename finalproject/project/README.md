TODO
A primitive beginning using Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS, SQL, and some APIs.I used a flask framework with templates, static, python, and SQL. The templates stores my core layout and my 3 other HTML files extend this layout.

The python code runs the templates, but also takes GET / POST requests and provides a dynamic webpage. The code performs some error checking and returns data back to the client side.

The SQL database stores the necessary data so that it is not lost. It has a primary key and autoincrement, which is quite annoying and only works one certain way (similar to problem set 9).

A Google Maps API is implemented on the maps.html to embed into the webpage. A weather widget was included in the weather.html webpage. The index template also leverages Jinja code to dynamically add table rows. I am still challenged with the API side of things and how they work well. I intend to watch more videos and practice API implementation to strengthen my skills. Hopefully I can implement them well in future projects.

The reason I decided to use these languages is because I want to get better at HMTL, CSS, Javascript, and Python. I believe these are core languages and building these fundamentals well will help me learn new languages and tools easily. As such, I had to implement the flask API similar to PS9. While the result is quite basic, I am very proud of my work. I did very well in all of the labs and problem sets, which really solidified my confidence with programming. I was strong in university and always wanted to code since second year of university, but decided against it. However, I really want to become proficient in 2023 and hopefully build a career in the tech industry.
