#### Description:
TODO
A primitive beginning using Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS, SQL, and some APIs.
I used a flask framework with templates, static, python, and SQL.
The templates stores my core layout and my 3 other HTML files extend this layout.
The python code runs the templates, but also takes GET / POST requests and provides a dynamic webpage.
The SQL database stores the necessary data so that it is not lost.
A Google Maps API is implemented on the maps.html to embed into the webpage.
A weather widget was included in the weather.html webpage.
The index template also leverages Jinja code to dynamically add table rows.
CS50 is amazing!
