sort1 uses: Bubble

How do you know?: Omega(n). Because it is slower for reveresed and random because of additional movements. For sorted data it is fast because when moving data, it will not take as long.

sort2 uses: Merge

How do you know?: Theta (nlogn). Because it is the fastest essentially.

sort3 uses: Selection

How do you know?: Omega(n^2) because it is slower for reversed and random, but not for already sorted data. It goes through the entire data to confirm one at a time.
